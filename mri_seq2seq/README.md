# Seq2Seq: Sequence-to-Sequence Generator
We are committed to exploring the application of synthesis or fusion for multi-sequence MRI (also including other modalities such as CT) in clinical settings.

Seq2Seq is a series of dynamic multi-domain models that can translate an arbitrary sequence to a target sequence.
- If you are looking for a straightforward way to use it without much thought, please try [nnSeq2Seq](#nnseq2seq).
- To learn more information about our work, please refer to our [publications](#publications).

Referring to [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet), we propose nnSeq2Seq, a tool for adaptively training Seq2Seq models with a given dataset. It will analyze the provided training cases and automatically configure a matching synthesis pipeline. No expertise is required on your end! You can easily train the models and use them for your application.

### What functions does nnSeq2Seq have?
- Input one/multiple images $\rightarrow$ output one image
  - [x] Missing sequence/modality synthesis
    - Input: [CT] $\rightarrow$ Output: [PET]
    - Input: [T1, T2, DWI, ADC] $\rightarrow$ Output: [DCE]
  - [x] Segmentation
    - Input: [DCE] $\rightarrow$ Output: [Tumor]
    - Input: [T1, T1Gd, T2, FLAIR] $\rightarrow$ Output: [Tumor]
  - [x] vector quantized common (VQC)-latent space compression
    - Input: [CT] $\rightarrow$ Output: [VQC]
    - Input: [T1, T2] $\rightarrow$ Output: [VQC, VQC]
- Explainability and visualization
  - [x] Synthesis-based sequence contribution
  - [x] Imaging differentiation map
  - [x] Task-specific sequence contribution
  - [x] Task-specific enhanced map
